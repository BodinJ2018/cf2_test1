# Computer Fundamentals II Exam 1
Good luck on your Final Exam!
Your task is to recreate the image below using html, css, and bootstrap. The only difference between this image and your final website should be the final problem, where you should write out a fact that you recall from each of the units.

Problems #1,2,3, and 5 are all listed in index.html
Problems #4 is listed in style.css
Making these changes will lead you to your goal of finishing the exam!


## But Wait Mr. Gold, how do I get your index.html?
### Great question, excellent student. See the button called Fork in the upper right hand corner? Press that and then you have my repository! Then you can clone into unbuntu as if its yours!
## How should I submit the work?
### When you are satisfied with your work, Add, Commit, Pull, and Push!  I will be checking in your account for a repo named cf2_test1




May the odds be forever in your favor!
